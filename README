 sbed - screen based editor

 2008 (c) by Christian Garbs <mitch@cgarbs.de>


This is a text editor with a resemblance to IBMs ISPF editor.
While I have found some free editors that support "line commands",
they lack the "screen based editing".  So to get the real feeling
of a 3270 terminal or terminal emulation, I knew I had to write my
own editor.  I recently came across dvtm and madtty and now I
finally have a screen library that is (hopefully) fit for my needs
as well as a simple and lucid application to use as an example of
how to use this screen library.
