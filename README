 sbed - screen based editor

 2009 (c) by Christian Garbs <mitch@cgarbs.de>


This is a text editor with a resemblance to IBMs ISPF editor.
While I have found some free editors that support "line commands",
they lack the "screen based editing".  So to get the real feeling
of a 3270 terminal or terminal emulation, I knew I had to write my
own editor.
